# MudletWTTR

This is a fun and silly package I threw together for displaying weather reports in a Mudlet miniconsole.
It uses https://wttr.in to get the reports and then just runs it through ansi2decho to push to the miniconsole.

## Commands

This is a pretty simple thing. You can check the `wttr` alias to get a list of aliases it recognizes.
